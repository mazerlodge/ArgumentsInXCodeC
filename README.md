# ArgumentsInXCodeC

Just a quick demo of setting and processing arguments
in an XCode C project.

Bottom line: Debug arguments are set through Product Menu -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme
or Clover-< for short.

Other arg notes, use ' or " around args with spaces or '\ ' to escape the space.
When args with spaces are put in a build scheme, you must supply the quoting.
